I work on some really cool projects.  💅🏾

Like a Megan thee Stallion Lyric Generator, where you can create new MTS inspired verses like:

pussy taste like cherry kiwi 
real big titties whole lotta niggas you know they wanna be me
bitch i was chose i ain't talkin' 'bout his followers dollars and your honor i'm a open book 
big mad 'cause your baby back see me 
hottie uh creole mami huh she think she bad but i'm dramatic hey

My Data Science Master's Degree Capstone was on predicting[ NHL goals](https://github.com/Ayodeleohh/hockeyGoals). 🏒🥅🚨

[Girlfight](https://github.com/Ayodeleohh/Girlfight) 🐾 A rudimentary python dictionary to explore popular female rap beefs. To save time Azalea Banks' full list of beefs has been excluded.

Interesting to know the rapper who has gotten into the least amount of beefs is Khia. The “My Neck, My Back” rapper has only been in one major beef with  Trina.

[Trump Regrets](https://github.com/Ayodeleohh/Trump-Regrets) 😭 As part of my Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing course in grad school, I created a sentiment analysis comparing the tweets of Donald Trump to those who regret voting for him. Below is a word cloud of common words used by those who regret voting for him.

- I'm passionate about Data Science education
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects & papers around machine bias, fairness metrics, & understanding power structures in AI.
